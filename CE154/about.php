        <p class="about__body">Glass Castles was a small indie-pop band that formed in the winter of 2012 in a small town on the outskirts of London, England.
            The band consisted of four friends: Emily, the lead vocalist and keyboardist; Jack, the guitarist; Olivia, the bassist; and Liam, the drummer.</p>

        <p class="about__body">The four friends had met while attending the same music school and quickly bonded over their shared love of indie-pop music. They spent countless
            hours practicing and writing songs in Jack's basement, dreaming of one day making it big in the music industry.</p>

        <p class="about__body">After several months of hard work and dedication, Glass Castles finally got their big break when they were discovered 
            by a local music producer who had seen them perform at a small gig in a local bar. The producer was impressed with their unique sound and offered to help them record their first EP.</p>

        <p class="about__body">With the producer's help, Glass Castles recorded their first EP, which they titled "Fragments of Glass." The EP featured four original songs, all of which were written and composed by
            the band members themselves. They released the EP independently and began promoting it through social media and local gigs.</p>

        <p class="about__body">Their hard work soon paid off when "Fragments of Glass" began receiving positive reviews from music critics and gained a small but dedicated following. Glass Castles continued to
            perform at local gigs and festivals, building up their fanbase and honing their skills as performers.</p>

        <p class="about__body">In 2015, Glass Castles released their debut album, "Broken Glass," which was met with critical acclaim and helped to further establish their presence in the indie-pop scene.
            They continued to tour and perform, and even gained the attention of major record labels, but ultimately decided to remain independent and continue making music on their own terms.</p>

        <p class="about__body">Despite the challenges and obstacles they faced as a small indie band, Glass Castles never gave up on their dream of making music and connecting with their audience. Their passion and 
            dedication to their craft inspired countless others, and their music continues to resonate with fans around the world.</p>
